The cloud is resilient servers delivered as a service over the internet, and the resources are delivered on demand. 

How to determine if something is in the cloud
Services are available on demand on the internet

Adv of cloud?
Store as much data as 50k libraries.

Has its own power supply so they keep running in the event of a blackout.

High security.


Types of cloud
Public cloud - multiple occupant cloud. Many people share the specific physical server(s).

Private - cloud infrastructure dedicated to a private company. Does not have to be connected to the internet, like cruise ships.

Hybrid - mix between on prem and in the cloud

Types of cloud services (see Trello card)
Saas like Office 365


What are some advantages/disadvantages of using the cloud?
Reliability - backup infrastructure. Scalability
Less control

What are the disadvantages of using hybrid cloud or multi-cloud?
Complexity: Multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments can be complex to manage because they involve multiple cloud providers and technologies.

Cost: Multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments can be more expensive than single-cloud environments because they require more resources to manage.

Security: Multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments can be more difficult to secure than single-cloud environments because they involve multiple cloud providers and technologies.

Integration: Multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments can be difficult to integrate with existing IT infrastructure.



On-prem vs cloud: What is usually cheaper for an organisation? Explain
Cloud is cheaper - scalability. Cloud storage cheaper than on prem storage


Which cloud provider is the best? Why?



What is Azure? 
See Trello card
Management groups - allows you to manage subscriptions, set policies, enforces compliance

CapEx vs OPEx
Capital Expenditure is paid up front when on prem
Operational Expenditure is spread out over time (monthly)
CapEx mostly on prem
OpEx mostly cloud

Tags are key:value pairs
e.g. Team: Sales 1

ARM - acute resource manager. It is the API that manages Azure.
