# Cloud & Azure

## What is the cloud?
The cloud is resilient servers delivered as a service over the internet, and the resources are delivered on demand. 

How to determine if something is in the cloud
Services are available on demand on the internet.

## Advantages of the cloud
- Store as much data as 50k libraries.
- Has its own power supply so they keep running in the event of a blackout.
- High security.


## Types of cloud
**Public cloud** - multiple occupant cloud. Many people share the specific physical server(s).

**Private cloud** - cloud infrastructure dedicated to a private company. Does not have to be connected to the internet, like cruise ships.

**Hybrid cloud** - mix between on prem and in the cloud

Types of cloud services (see Trello card)
Saas like Office 365


W**hat are some advantages/disadvantages of using the cloud?**
Reliability - backup infrastructure. Scalability
Less control

What are the disadvantages of using hybrid cloud or multi-cloud?
Complexity: Multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments can be complex to manage because they involve multiple cloud providers and technologies.

Cost: Multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments can be more expensive than single-cloud environments because they require more resources to manage.

Security: Multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments can be more difficult to secure than single-cloud environments because they involve multiple cloud providers and technologies.

Integration: Multi-cloud or hybrid cloud environments can be difficult to integrate with existing IT infrastructure.



On-prem vs cloud: What is usually cheaper for an organisation? Explain
Cloud is cheaper - scalability. Cloud storage cheaper than on prem storage

## Azure

### What is Azure? 
There are four levels of organisation:
![Levels](https://imgur.com/WqeUUSC)

- Management groups - allows you to manage subscriptions, set policies, enforces compliance
- Subscriptions
- Resource groups - this is a container that groups multiple resources together so they can be managed as a single entity
- Tags - these are custom labels that can be set so that certain VMs can be grouped together

### CapEx vs OPEx
Capital Expenditure is paid up front when on prem
Operational Expenditure is spread out over time (monthly)
CapEx mostly on prem
OpEx mostly cloud


ARM - acute resource manager. It is the API that manages Azure.
