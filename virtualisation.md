# Virtualisation

## What is Virtualisation?
In a nutshell, virtualisation is the process of creating a software-based representation of something rather than a physical one.

This can include virtual computer hardware platforms, virtual storage devices and virtual computer networks.

## What is a Virtual Machine (VM)?

A virtual machine is a simulated computing environment.

It is a software-based version of a computer that behaves like an actual computer.

## Where can VMs be run?

VMs can be run on a physical machine.

## What determines how many can run?

There are many factors that can determine how many VMs can run, including:
- CPU capability
- Data storage
- RAM
- Network Interface Controller (NIC)
- Virtualisation software version

## What does a virtual machine include?

It has a CPU, memory, disks to store your files, and can connect to the internet if needed. 

Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and functions separately from the other VMs, even when they are all running on the same host.

## What software is required to orchestrate/run the virtual machines?

Hypervisors are used to run VMs. There are different sorts, like Hyper-v and VMware.

## What is the importance of an image when creating an VM?

The image is important as it is used to launch the VM in the cloud. 

It contains an operating system, boot loader and root file system.
